/*
 * FILE: rdt_receiver.cc
 * DESCRIPTION: Reliable data transfer receiver.
 * NOTE: This implementation assumes there is no packet loss, corruption, or 
 *       reordering.  You will need to enhance it to deal with all these 
 *       situations.  In this implementation, the packet format is laid out as 
 *       the following:
 *       
 *       |<-  1 byte  ->|<-             the rest            ->|
 *       | payload size |<-             payload             ->|
 *
 *       The first byte of each packet indicates the size of the payload
 *       (excluding this single-byte header)
